## Calculations 

This is a calorie and macronutrients calculator. It was coded using the *Revised Harrisâ€“Benedict Equation* and a 35% protein, 45% carb and 20% fat macro split. 

## Getting the app 

If you're on a x86 based Machine running Arch Linux or on Windows, you can download one the pre built binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/pedro-git-projects/calories-and-macros-calculator/releases).  

Otherwise, you'll have to build it from source. If that is the case there are two dependencies:

- The Go Programming Language
- GCC

Once this two softwares are installed, you may run Make install if you're on a Unix system. Or run the go build command otherwise.
